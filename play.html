    <h3>A Woman of no Importance</h3>

    <h4>_Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s_.  _Large open French window at back_,
        _looking on to garden_.  _Doors_ R.C. _and_ L.C.</h4>
        
       <p id="special_1"> [GERALD ARBUTHNOT _writing at table_.]
        
           [_Enter_ ALICE R.C. _followed by_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]</p>
        
        ALICE.  Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.
        
      <p id="special_2">  [_Exit_ L.C.]</p>
        
       <p> <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  Good morning, Gerald.
        
       <h6> GERALD.</h6>  [_Rising_.]  Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs.
        Allonby. </p>
        
        <p>  <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  [_Sitting down_.]  We came to inquire for your dear
        mother, Gerald.  I hope she is better? 
        
        <h6>GERALD.</h6>  My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton. </p>
        
       <P> <h6> HUNSTANTON.</h6>  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last
        night.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it
        was the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets
        on one’s nerves.
        
        <h6> ALLONBY.</h6> It’s the same thing, nowadays. </p>
        
       <p> <h6> HUNSTANTON. </h6> I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am
        afraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.
        Arbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?
        
        <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>  [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]  It looks
        quite the happy English home. </p>
        
        <p><h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.
        One feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,
        Gerald.
        
        <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that
        a good influence is the worst in the world. </p>
        
       <p> <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he
        will change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.
        
        <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English
        home. </p>
        
        <p> <h6>HUNSTANTON.</h6>  It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women
        in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but
        orchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a
        sweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures
        that one can look at without blushing.
        
        <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>  But I like blushing. </p>
        
        <p> <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,
        if one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell
        me I didn’t blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very
        particular.  He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those
        who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,
        was brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.
        
        <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>  I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the
        devotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man. </p>
        
        <p> <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?
        By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more
        often now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you?
        
        <h6>GERALD.</h6>  I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s
        secretary. </p>
